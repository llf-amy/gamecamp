Since the *pos* and *size* of the rectangle, together with the *center_x* and *top* of the score labels were defined within the context of the `PongGame` class, these properties will automatically update when the corresponding widget properties change. Using the Kv language gives you automatic property binding. :)\n",

    "Cool, so now we have a ball, and it even has a move function... but it’s not moving yet. Let’s fix that. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Scheduling Functions on the Clock\n",
    "\n",
    "We need the move method of our ball to be called regularly. Luckily, Kivy makes this pretty easy by letting us schedule any function we want using the [`Clock`](https://kivy.org/docs/api-kivy.clock.html#kivy.clock.Clock) and specifying the interval:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Clock.schedule_interval(game.update, 1.0/60.0)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Object Properties/References\n",
    "\n",
    "We have another problem though. We’d like to make sure the `PongBall` has its move function called regularly, but in our code we don’t have any references to the ball object since we just added it via the kv file inside the kv rule for the `PongGame` class. The only reference to our game is the one we return in the applications build method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we’re going to have to do more than just move the ball (e.g. bounce it off the walls and later the players racket), we’ll probably need an update method for our `PongGame` class anyway. Furthermore, given that we have a reference to the game object already, we can easily schedule its new update method when the application gets built (`main.py`):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from kivy.clock import Clock\n",

    "\n",

    "        return game\n",
    "```\n",
    "However, that still doesn’t change the fact that we don’t have a reference to the `PongBall` child widget created by the kv rule. To fix this, we can add an [`ObjectProperty`](https://kivy.org/docs/api-kivy.properties.html#kivy.properties.ObjectProperty) to the PongGame class, and hook it up to the widget created in the kv rule.
